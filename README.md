# Code analyzer

This project has the aim to provide feedback to programmers write better code.

### Object Calisthenics Rules

Object calisthenics is a set of rules that you can follow when you are writing object oriented code to improve its quality. Achieving what everyone want: maintanability, readability and understandability.
These are the rules:

- One level of indentation per method
- Don't use the else keyword
- Wrap all primitives and strings
- Use only one dot per line
- Don't abbreviate
- Keep all entities small
- No classes with more than two instance variables
- No getters/setters/properties
- First-class collections
- One responsibility per class

Initially, the code analyzer will follow just the object calisthenics basic rules to analyze your code.

### Feedback

The feedback will be like this:
```Class x: line y uses two methods at the same line ( Rule 4 -> Use only one dot per line )```

### Languages
- Java
- Perl
